# TawsilGo Logo Design Brief

## Project Overview
**Brand Name:** TawsilGo
**Industry:** Cross-border parcel logistics (Europe ↔ Morocco)
**Target Audience:** Moroccan diaspora in Europe, families sending parcels home
**Brand Positioning:** Professional bus-based delivery service with community trust and competitive pricing

## Brand Etymology & Meaning

**"TawsilGo"** combines:
- **Trans-**: Latin prefix meaning "across, beyond" (transportation, transcontinental)
- **-alam**: Arabic "عالم" (ʿālam) meaning "world, universe"
  - Also evokes "salam" (سلام) = peace/greeting
  - Cultural bridge between European and Moroccan identity

**Core Message:** "Across Worlds" or "Transcending Worlds" - bridging Europe and Morocco through reliable parcel delivery

## Logo Concept: Moroccan Arch Bridge (RECOMMENDED)

### Visual Elements

#### Primary Icon/Mark

**Concept:** A stylized Moroccan horseshoe arch formed by geometric zellige tile patterns, creating a bridge symbol

**Design Details:**
- Horseshoe arch shape (iconic Moroccan architecture)
- Arch composed of simplified zellige geometric patterns (not decorative, modern/flat design)
- Negative space between arch pillars subtly suggests a bus/vehicle silhouette
- Gradient from moroccan-mint (#00D4AA) on left/Europe side to chefchaouen-blue (#0080C8) on right/Morocco side

**Inspiration References:**
- Moroccan riads' archways
- Hassan II Mosque entrance (simplified geometric interpretation)
- Barcelona's Arc de Triomf (European architectural connection)

#### Typography

**Primary Wordmark:** "TAWSILGO"

**Style Options:**

**Option A (Bilingual Fusion):**
- "TRANS" in European modern sans-serif (Inter, Helvetica Neue)
- "ALAM" in slightly modified font with subtle Arabic calligraphy influence (curved endings)
- Unified weight and size for cohesion

**Option B (Modern Geometric):**
- Single modern sans-serif with custom "A" glyph incorporating Moroccan arch shape in the counter
- Clean, minimal, highly scalable
- Example fonts: Poppins, Montserrat, DM Sans

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
```
Moroccan Mint: #00D4AA (trust, freshness, growth)
Chefchaouen Blue: #0080C8 (iconic Moroccan city, reliability)
```

**Supporting Colors:**
```
Moroccan Gold: #D4AF37 (premium services, verified badges)
Desert Sand: #E8D5C4 (warm backgrounds, approachable)
Saffron Orange: #E67E22 (CTAs, urgency indicators)
```

**Neutral Base:**
```
White: #FFFFFF
Black: #1A1A1A
Gray Scale: #F5F5F5, #E0E0E0, #9E9E9E, #4A4A4A
```

## Technical Specifications

### File Formats Needed

**Vector Files:**
- `.svg` (primary, for web)
- `.ai` or `.eps` (Adobe Illustrator editable source)
- `.pdf` (print-ready vector)

**Raster Files:**
- `.png` with transparency (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024px)
- `.jpg` on white background (for print)
- `.webp` (optimized for web)

### Color Variants

1. **Full Color:** Moroccan mint to blue gradient (primary usage)
2. **Solid Color:** Single moroccan-mint (#00D4AA) for simplified applications
3. **Monochrome:** Black (#1A1A1A) for single-color printing
4. **Reverse:** White on dark backgrounds
5. **Grayscale:** For fax/photocopying

### Accessibility Requirements

- Logo must work on both light and dark backgrounds
- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 (WCAG AA standard)
- Must be recognizable when scaled to 24px height
- Icon should be distinguishable without color (shape-based recognition)

## Design Principles

### DO:
✅ Keep geometric shapes clean and modern
✅ Ensure scalability from favicon (16px) to billboard
✅ Balance cultural authenticity with contemporary design
✅ Test legibility in grayscale/monochrome
✅ Design for digital-first applications (crisp at screen resolutions)
✅ Create flexible lockups for various aspect ratios

### DON'T:
❌ Use overly decorative/traditional Moroccan patterns (avoid cliché)
❌ Make it too complex (won't scale to small sizes)
❌ Rely solely on color for brand recognition
❌ Use gradients that don't translate to print
❌ Create tight letter spacing that becomes illegible when small
❌ Use more than 3 colors in the primary version

## Competitive Context

**Avoid resemblance to:**
- DHL (red/yellow diagonal)
- FedEx (purple/orange arrow)
- UPS (brown shield)
- Atlas Van Lines (globe with routes)

**Differentiate through:**
- Moroccan architectural elements (arch shape)
- Mint/blue color combination (distinct from logistics industry standard reds/yellows)
- Cultural bridge symbolism (not just speed/efficiency)
- Warm, approachable vs corporate-cold

## Tagline Placement (Optional)

**Suggested Taglines:**
1. "Your Bridge Home"
2. "Connecting Europe & Morocco"
3. "Delivering Memories, Not Just Packages"

**Placement:** Tagline should sit below wordmark in stacked version, or to the right in horizontal lockup, in a lighter weight font, 30-40% size of main wordmark

**Notes for Designers:**

- Review the TawsilGo platform (nextjs-app) codebase for existing visual style
- Current brand color (moroccan-mint #00D4AA) is already integrated in UI - logo should harmonize
- Study Moroccan zellige patterns for geometric inspiration, but simplify dramatically
- Logo will be used heavily in mobile contexts - prioritize thumb-sized legibility

**Inspiration Board:** [Link to Pinterest board with Moroccan architecture, modern logistics brands, geometric Islamic art]
